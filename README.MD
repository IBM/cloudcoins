Kubecoin
--------

Kubecoin is a blockchain/fitness concept that uses a mobile app to convert a participant's footsteps into our own crypo-currency 'kubecoins'.

Insurance companies, Government agencies, and employers are all interested in encouraging healthiness of clients, citizens, staff. For example, [Carrot Rewards](https://www.carrotrewards.ca/home/) from Canadian federal and provincial government agencies.

While it's an admirable approach, participants are vulnerable in sharing health information with insurance companies, government agencies and employers.

Kubecoin tackles this problem by working anonymously. It doesn't ask for a participant's name, or gender, or health data. It places steps walked in a blockchain, so the data is encrypted, yet trusted - sourced directly from the participant's mobile device. If they delete the app, their Kubecoins are lost, their history gone.

##### Why we built it

We built Kubecoin to demonstrate how blockchain can be used to exchange different kinds of value. In this case, footsteps for kubecoins ... although in some ways we're exchanging attention for marketing information. Carrot Rewards exchanges your footsteps for health information, although they also learn about the participants, since it is not anonymous, and they take other factors of your personal information into account.

Blockchain, as much as it offers technical strengths - for security, data integrity etc, also challenges us to think about the value of data. Our data. We've seen recently how our social data can be exploited. The future will be influenced by different approaches to data value and ownership.

We built Kubecoin to play with IBM's Cloud technology ... Kubernetes, Blockchain, Cloud Functions, Mongo by Compose, Node ... and in the future, with Machine Learning and Watson.
